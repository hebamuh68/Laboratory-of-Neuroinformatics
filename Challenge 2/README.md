## Overview

This Python script, exemplified by example.py, addresses the analysis of a group of mice living in a four-room house (Rooms 1, 2, 3, 4) over a three-day experiment. Each mouse is identified by a unique number (e.g., ‘0065-0136670531’). The entire experiment spans three days and is subdivided into six 12-hour long phases, alternately named PHASE 1 dark, PHASE 1 light, PHASE 2 dark, and so forth.

## Objectives
The script aims to perform the following tasks:

- Individual Mouse Activity
- Pairwise Mouse Interaction
- Results Storage

## How to Run
Execute the scripts as follows:

```
python example.py
```
